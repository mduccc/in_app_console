Run `bash scripts/check_version_consistent.sh` from the repository root and report the results to the user.

If the script exits with code 0, confirm that all versions are consistent.

If the script exits with a non-zero code, list every ❌ line from the output and explain what needs to be fixed (which file and what value it should be updated to).
